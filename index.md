# Why
### Real Problem
Sometimes people are hot and people are cold so they change the temperature in the whole room. But it would be great if we had micro-climates around each person in a space. We would have happier workers because not everyone can always agree on the temperature.  We would also use less energy to cool/heat smaller areas, around someone's desk for example, rather than an entire room.

The process of deciding the temperature should be automated, which requires a computer to understand whether the human is comfortable or not.

### Goal
Take a thermal image of the user and determine if they like the temperature or not.

There have been many studies on the Thermal Comfort of both people and animals.  Studies have used Thermal Comfort as an indicator of the observed person's happiness in their environment.  This is potentially important to office designers and car manufacturers, who want to maximize happiness of people in their spaces.

Recently, there have been more energy efficient buildings which rely on new methods for cooling/heating.  To test different systems effectiveness there has been [research using the building inhabitants' thermal comfort as an indicator of effectiveness](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132311002800).  Specifically in subtropical climates which tend to be hot and humid, like southeast Asia, the invention of air conditioning has [been called by the previous Prime Minister of Singapore](https://www.vox.com/2015/3/23/8278085/singapore-lee-kuan-yew-air-conditioning) "one of the signal inventions of history."  Because of this there is a significant interest in [research on optimizing the energy use and effectiveness of cooling systems in those areas](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261907001602).
